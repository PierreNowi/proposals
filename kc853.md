#Find minimum energy distribution of low-density vortices on a 3D space.
#
#This problem is trivially parallelizable because we use a Monte Carlo approach to get statistical results for the distribution spectrum. However, it is possible to parallelize our code so that each sample run can be faster. As a result, we can simulate the behavior of vortex distribution on a larger grid.
#
#I did not bother to parallelize the computation because initial results on different grids suggest that sizes would not affect our results. As an exercise, it will be interesting to see how much performance improvement is possible but the result may not provide too much scientific insights.
#
#I find the proposals by xz388 (Edge-Weighted Personalized PageRank) interesting.
