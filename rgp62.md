# Parallelizing the Initialization of Cluster Induced Turbulence Simulations in NGA
CTFLab performs Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with the group's multiphase flow solver, NGA. NGA is written to be massively parallel and has shown excellent scaling characteristics, even running on tens of thousands of threads. However, several initialization routines remain serial. For very large simulations, the initialization can take extremely long to perform on a single thread or even fail due to inadequate memory. The goal of this project will be to improve the initialization performance of the Cluster Induced Turbulence (CIT) simulation case. This case simulates turbulence generation by falling particles that begin randomly and homogeneously distributed in fluid. CIT simulations may lead to a better understanding of physical processes as diverse as cloud formation and fluidization. We will focus on optimizing single thread performance and parallelizing the CIT initialization code. We will then measure the changes in timing and memory usage over the existing implementation as well as perform a strong and weak scaling analysis. As NGA is written in Fortran 90, an understanding of Fortran 90 will be required for this project.
